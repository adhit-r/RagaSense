## Next Steps Priority Order

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Configure OAuth credentials** - Set up real authentication
2. **Run enhanced training pipeline** - Improve model accuracy

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **Implement hybrid ML deployment** - Connect ML models to production
4. **End-to-end testing** - Validate complete system

### Medium Term (Next Month)
5. **Production deployment** - Go live with CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (web, iOS, Android)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PyTorch ML models
- **Database**: Convex (real-time, authentication, file storage)
- **ML**: Enhanced training pipeline with 40+ features

### Integration Points
- Flutter ↔ Convex (user auth, data storage)
- Convex ↔ FastAPI (ML inference)
- FastAPI ↔ ML Models (local inference)

## Success Metrics

### Completed
- ✅ Repository cleanup and organization
- ✅ Convex integration (frontend + backend)
- ✅ Authentication service structure
- ✅ Configuration centralization
- ✅ Security hardening

### Target Metrics
- 🎯 OAuth authentication working
- 🎯 ML model deployment operational
- 🎯 End-to-end system functional
- 🎯 Production deployment live
- 🎯 Enhanced model accuracy (95-99%)

## Notes

- All issues use GitHub CLI for management
- No emojis in issue titles or descriptions
- Focus on practical, implementable features
- Removed speculative/future features from roadmap
- Current roadmap is production-focused and achievable
