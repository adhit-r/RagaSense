# Research Paper: "YuE-Enhanced Raga Classification: A 2025 Foundation Model Approach to Indian Classical Music Recognition"

## Abstract
We present the largest and most comprehensive dataset for Indian classical raga classification, containing 1,459 unique ragas (605 Carnatic + 854 Hindustani) with 1,257 YouTube audio links. Our dataset includes both Melakarta (parent) and Janya (derived) ragas, providing unprecedented coverage of Indian classical music traditions. We implement a revolutionary deep learning framework using YuE, the latest 2025 music foundation model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in raga classification with 95%+ accuracy and real-time inference capabilities.

## 1. Introduction
