# GitHub Project Board Setup Guide

> **Complete guide for setting up and managing the RagaSense development project board**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

This guide will help you set up a comprehensive GitHub Project board to track the development progress of RagaSense features and improvements. The project board will provide visual organization of issues, milestones, and development workflow.

## ðŸ“‹ **Prerequisites**

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo` scope
2. **Repository Access** to `adhit-r/RagaSense`
3. **Python Environment** with `requests` library

## ðŸš€ **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install requests

# Or if using requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Set Up GitHub Token**

```bash
# Set your GitHub Personal Access Token
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token_here'

# For permanent setup, add to your shell profile
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**To create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select `repo` scope
4. Copy the token and use it in the export command above

### **Step 3: Create Roadmap Issues**

```bash
# Run the issue creation script
python scripts/create_roadmap_issues.py
```

This script will:
- âœ… Create 4 milestones (Phase 1-4)
- âœ… Create 18+ labels for categorization
- âœ… Create 23 roadmap issues with proper labels and milestones
- âœ… Link issues to the roadmap document

### **Step 4: Set Up GitHub Project Board**

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/adhit-r/RagaSense
2. **Click on "Projects" tab**
3. **Click "New project"**
4. **Choose "Board" layout**
5. **Name it**: "RagaSense Development Roadmap"
6. **Description**: "Track development progress for RagaSense features and improvements"
7. **Click "Create"**

### **Step 5: Configure Project Columns**

Add these columns to your project board:

1. **Backlog** - Issues planned but not yet started
2. **To Do** - Issues ready to be worked on
3. **In Progress** - Issues currently being developed
4. **Review** - Issues ready for code review and testing
5. **Testing** - Issues being tested and validated
6. **Done** - Completed issues

### **Step 6: Add Issues to Project Board**

1. **Click "Add items"** in each column
2. **Search for issues** by label (e.g., `label:phase-1`)
3. **Add all roadmap issues** to the appropriate columns
4. **Organize by priority** and phase

## ðŸ“Š **Project Board Views**

### **Main Board View**
- **Layout**: Board
- **Group by**: Status (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, etc.)
- **Sort by**: Priority (High â†’ Medium â†’ Low)

### **Phase Overview Views**
Create separate views for each development phase:

1. **Phase 1 Overview**
   - Filter: `label:phase-1`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

2. **Phase 2 Overview**
   - Filter: `label:phase-2`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

3. **Phase 3 Overview**
   - Filter: `label:phase-3`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

4. **Phase 4 Overview**
   - Filter: `label:phase-4`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

### **Category Views**
Create views for different development categories:

1. **ML Model Development**
   - Filter: `label:ml-model`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Filter: `label:frontend`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

3. **Backend Development**
   - Filter: `label:backend`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

4. **Database & Authentication**
   - Filter: `label:database`
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: Status

### **Priority Views**
Create views for priority management:

1. **High Priority Issues**
   - Filter: `label:high-priority`
   - Layout: Table
   - Sort by: Issue number

2. **Medium Priority Issues**
   - Filter: `label:medium-priority`
   - Layout: Table
   - Sort by: Issue number

3. **Low Priority Issues**
   - Filter: `label:low-priority`
   - Layout: Table
   - Sort by: Issue number

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow Management**

### **Issue Lifecycle**

1. **Issue Created** â†’ Automatically added to "Backlog"
2. **Ready for Development** â†’ Move to "To Do" + Add `ready` label
3. **Development Started** â†’ Move to "In Progress" + Add `in-progress` label
4. **Code Review** â†’ Move to "Review" + Add `needs-review` label
5. **Testing** â†’ Move to "Testing" + Add `testing` label
6. **Completed** â†’ Move to "Done" + Add `completed` label

### **Automation Rules**

Set up these automation rules in your project board:

1. **When issue is opened** â†’ Add to "Backlog" column
2. **When issue is labeled with `ready`** â†’ Move to "To Do" column
3. **When issue is assigned** â†’ Move to "In Progress" column
4. **When pull request is opened** â†’ Move linked issue to "Review" column
5. **When pull request is merged** â†’ Move linked issue to "Testing" column
